Experimenting with Go to create a WebServer API with basic CRUD operations

For now, placed basic skeleton of the web server into the file structure. Will set up a basic entry point, configure the dockerfile, and then work on creating the data storage model. At first I will create it as an in-memory storage solution, and once I complete that, I will set up a database or a save state option for the service.
